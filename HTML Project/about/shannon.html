      <h2>Shannon McQuaid - Lead Singer</h2>
      <p>
        Shannon is the charismatic frontwoman of the band and one of the founding members.
        Originally Jeff was attempting to recruit her for the his band,
        and funnily enough was competing for that position with Brian (he had no chance).
        That fell though, however, and eventually decided her, along with Jeff and Brian,
        would start their own band. Using her powerful vocals and emo stylings, she brings the melodic
        and powerful vocals to the band to give it their distinctive sound.
